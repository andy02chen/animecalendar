                        Hey there! Thanks for checking out my website. This is my first time launching a site, so please bear with me if you encounter any issues.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This site is designed to complement the MyAnimeList app. As a fellow MAL user, I found that while the anime tracker is useful, it can be a bit lacking. 
                        Keeping track of episode release dates has become a challenge, especially when watching multiple seasonal anime. That's why I created this siteâ€”to make tracking and managing your anime experience a bit easier.
                        <br/><br/>
                    </p>

                        - This site updates your anime progress and uses MAL data to calculate release dates and countdowns.<br/>
                        - You'll still need to manage your lists on MAL.<br/>
                        - I'm planning to keep improving the site.
